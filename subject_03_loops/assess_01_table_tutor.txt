Table tutor
===========

Write a program that helps children practice the multiplication tables from 1 to 10 in fixed order.
It should pose questions like:

How much is 7 x 8

It should repeat the question until it has been answered correctly for at least three consecutive times.
If a question has to be repeated for more than ten times, it should advise the pupil to get some sleep first.
