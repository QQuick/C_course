Write a program that neatly prints out tables for sin, cos and tan with a step size of 0.1 radians, ranging from 0 to 2 * pi.
Radians, sin, cos and tan should each have their own column, and there should be column headers.
Look up on the Internet how to compute sin, cos and tan in C.
Also look up formatting with printf in C.
