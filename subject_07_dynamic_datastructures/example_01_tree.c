/*
This program features recursion (functions calling themselves).

Don't use recursion if you don't need to,
but with tree-like data structurs it's truly indispensable.

Look up the concept of local variables and stack frames.
Use a pen and paper to draw the contents of memory at any point.
PLEASE DO SO INDEED!!
You'll learn a lot from it...

Tree-like datastructures are at the core of databases, OS'es and compilers.
The C compiler you're using rightnow stores your program as a tree.
It uses recursion all over the place, walking that tree to generate machine code.
