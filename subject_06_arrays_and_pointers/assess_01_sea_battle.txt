Sea battle
==========

Write a sea battle game.
The computer places ships randomly in a sea, denoted by a two dimensional array.
Ships are X'es, water are .'s.
There are three ship types:

XX = Zephyr
XXX = Destroyer
XXXX = Cruiser

Ships can be layed out horizontally or vertically.
You can guess coordinates of a ship and fire a missile.
A ship is sunk if all it's X'es are hit.
If all ships are sunk the game terminates.
Try to sink all ships using the smallest amount of missiles.

The sea with the ships should be displayed on the screen.
No need to clear the screen, you can just scroll up the previous situation.
