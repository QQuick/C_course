Adventure game
==============

Write a text based adventure game that allows you to move between several rooms,
utilizing objects that you pick up in those rooms, like keys, explosives, ropes and axes.

The basis is a large case statement, in which each case is a room.
Objects that you pick up are stored in variables.
You can only carry three objects simultaneously.
